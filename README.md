Tape Library File Archiver

# Goals
- Single binary file backup agent
- Archive the most recent file versions only
- Tape library support
- Encrypt files on tape

# Reasons for building this
- Bacula is not suited to my use case
- No other solutions really exist to archive to a tape drive

# Notes
Currently I am targeting the IBM TS3310 with this tool as that is the only tape library
I have access to.
